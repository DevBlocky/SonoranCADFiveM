## Developing: Working with submodules
If you are developing this source code we utilize git submodules in order to bundle 3rd party resources and external CAD submodules. In order to "clone" the submodules you will need to run some additional git commands each time you pull. 

The commands below will clone the git submodules and ensure your submodules are synced to the commit hash/branch/tag you have selected in your git CLI/GUI/IDE (ie. VS Code). When cloning the repo your first time, this will sync to the commit hashes pushed to the repo. Updating the branch of the submodules in your IDE will change what code is pulled for that particular submodule.

After Cloning Repository
Run the following commands after cloning to ensure the git submodule files are cloned...

```bash
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

### Resetting Git Submodule links to commited links
If you want to ensure git submodules are pulling the code specified by what has been commited to the repo, run this command before the commands listed above:
```bash
git submodule deinit -f --all
```
